# Trinity AI Frontend

This directory contains a minimal Next.js 14 application written in TypeScript.
It provides a basic chat interface that communicates with the Flask backend in
`app.py`.

## Development

1. Install dependencies (requires Node.js):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The app expects the Flask API to be running on `http://localhost:8000`.
